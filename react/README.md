# Filecoin Metadata Store

1. Install all dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Run a local network in the first terminal: (if you want to deploy on localhost)

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network using Hardhat. The network runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. You can customize the network configuration in `hardhat.config.ts`.

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. The contract is located in `packages/hardhat/contracts` and can be modified to suit your needs. The `yarn deploy` command uses the deploy script located in `packages/hardhat/deploy` to deploy the contract to the network. You can also customize the deploy script.

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`.
